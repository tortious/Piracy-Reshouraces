This bad boy is the main thing you will need if you are trying to download some pron. There are other, lighter alternatives but we can worry about those once you get used to this. This fucker is awesome, anyway, and very needed for mega.nz sites.

You are going to want to remove some bloat and make it a little easier on the eyes so it looks somewhat like mine in the picture. You will see along the lefthand side the **advanced options** section. 

Since someone else explained it better elsewhere, reference the picture below and follow the instructions to get it looking good. If you find this useless or tedius, feel free to skip as this is purely superficial.

### How to use it

For the most part, all you need to do is make sure you have JDL open and running. You can minimize or close it out and have it chill in your tray if you do not want it literally in front of you the whole time. 

Then all you need to do usually is highlight the address bar of the site where the video is and copy/cut, and JDL will grab the link. Moreover, if you have say a bunch of videos - like a youtube playlist, for example - you will be prompted whether you wanna download the whole list of videos or just the one. 

While most XXX are done with the above process, every now and again you may have to look on the page itself and see if there is a download link (the kind you would normally never click because popups n shit), and you right-click or highlight the link with your mouse and then just copy/use ````CTRL + C ```` and JDL will pick up the link and you won't even have to click it. You will know when JDL grabs the link because a little window will pop up telling you so. \


### List of Pron Resources

In general, [The Porn Dude](https://theporndude.com/) is an okay jumping off point. Depends on your niche. Also, a google search of the shit you like plus "reddit" and the term "where get," you will produce some fruitful results typically. Just make sure you check the year it was posted. Something from 10 years ago is obviously outdated. 

- [Porntrex](https://porntrex.com)
- [ePorner](https://eporner.com)
- [SpankBang](https://spankbang.com)
- [GoodPorn](https://goodporn.to)
- [HotPornFile](https://hotpornfile.org)
- [Sxyprn](https://sxyprn.com)
- [Porno365](http://porno365.sexy/) - this one is fickle. You search "porno365" in bing (anything but google) and then check the top results. You will know the correct one because when you scroll down it will autoload more videos and it will not just repeat/cycle through the same 20 or so.
